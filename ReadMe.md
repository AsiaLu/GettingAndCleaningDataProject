### Purpose of project

The purpose of this project is to achieve from a row data a tidy data set with the average of choosen variables for each activity and each subject. It can be achieved by following the steps below. 


### Steps to take

1. Download the data from the link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Unzip the data into a folder in your working directory. You should have there a folder called `"UCI HAR Dataset"`.

3. Put the `"run_analysis.R"` script to your working directory.

4. Run `source("run_analysis.R")`

5. Check out your working directory, you should have there a new file called `tidy_data_set.txt`


### Required packages

The `"run_analysis.R"` script requires a package `"reshape2"` to be installed (if you are taking the Getting and Cleaning Data course you most probably have it already installed).
